            <h2>Visualization Settings</h2>
            RainbowSTORM's visualization settings are used to set the reconstruction method (scatter plot, averaged gaussian image) and magnification for the image reconstruction.
            Reconstruction Methods:
            <ul>
                <li>Scatter Plot: Super-resolution reconstruction generated from equally weighted points representing the x and y position of each localization</li>

                    representing the x and y positions of each localization where the radius of each Gaussian corresponds to the localization uncertainty.</li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Filters</h2>

            <h2>Restrict to ROI button</h2>
            ImageJ's rectangular selection tool is used to select a region of interest(ROI) in the sSMLM reconstruction then pressing the "Restrict to ROI" button to select localizations within the ROI 
           
            <h2>Display 3D sSMLM button</h2>
            The "Display 3D sSMLM" button is only available for 3D sSMLM images acquired using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1153529">astigmatism method</a>.                                                                                                     astigmatism method. 
            Pressing this button renders a stack of images color-code by their spectral centroid with each image in the stack based on the axial information for each localization.
            
            <h2>Classify by Centroid button</h2>
            The "Classify by Centroid" button launches the RainbowSTORM Classification screen where localizations can be grouped into color-coded image windows based on their spectral centroids.
            
            <h2>Calculate FRC button</h2>
            Pressing the "Calculate FRC" button performs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2448">Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) analysis</a> for the sSMLM super-resolution reconstruction. 
            FRC analysis takes spatial sampling and localization uncertainty into consideration when determining the resolution of super-resolution reconstructions.
            The resulting FRC plot and Fourier Image REsolution(FIRE) number are generated.
            
            <h2>Reset sSMLM Data button</h2>
            Pressing the "Reset sSMLM Data" button removes any RainbowSTORM filters or drift-correction which have been applied to the data.

            The spectroscopic data currently displayed can be saved as two CSV file for future analysis. 
            The first file saves all RainbowSTORM fields and the second file includes all RainbowSTORM fields as well as the values for the full spectrum range. 
            RainbowSTORM appends the "_spec" to the second file which can be loaded into RainbowSTORM using the Import screen.
