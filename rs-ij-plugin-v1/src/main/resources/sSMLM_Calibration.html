        <div>   <h1>RainbowSTORM sSMLM Calibration</h1>
        
            <h2>Uncalibrated Spectrum Plot:</h2>
            The uncalibrated spectrum plot shows the average line plot from the calibration image. 
               Double-click on the red uncalibrated line plot starting with the first major peak which represents the spatial image pixel position.
            
            <h2>Calibrated Spectrum  Plot:</h2>
            The calibrated spectrum plot shows the resulting line plot after calibration.
            
            <h2>Pixel vs Wavelength Plot:</h2>
            The pixel versus wavelength plot shows the relationship between the pixels and wavelengths as well as the fitting result after calibration
            
            <h2> Current Peak Text field:</h2>
            The current peak text field shows the value from the uncalibrated spectrum line plot. This field can also be manually updated.
            
            <h2>Peak Position text fields:</h2>
            The spatial and spectral peak position text fields can be updated with the peak pixel values from the current peak text field by pressing the set button or manually. 
            Only one text field is enabled for editing at a time. The enabled text field is highlighted in green.
            
            <h2>Set button:</h2>
            The Set button can be pressed to update the enabled pixel position text field. 
                The value from the current peak position text field value will be transfered to the enabled pixel position text field.
                The updated text field will be disabled and the next text field will be enabled.
            
            <h2>Next button:</h2>
            The Next button allows the user to enable the next peak position text field.
            
            <h2>Previous button:</h2>
            The Previous button allows the user to enable the previous peak position text field.
            
            <h2>Slit/Emitter Position:</h2>
            Starting position for he spatial information.
            
            <h2>Wavelength Text Fields:</h2>
            Wavelength information corresponding to each uncalibrated spectral peak.
            
            <h2>Calibration Source Combobox:</h2>
            RainbowSTORM allows for calibration using a calibration light source (calibration lamp or multiple laser lines) or a single multi-color fluorescent bead.
            
            <h2>Dispersive Element Combobox:</h2>
            Grating-based or prism-based systems can be calibrated using RainbowSTORM.
            Calibration for grating-based systems uses linear fitting. 
            Calibration of prism-based systems can be done using either second-order or third-order fitting.
            
            <h2>Calibrate Button:</h2>
            Pressing the calibrate button performs calibration for the selected calibration source type and dispersive element.
            
            <h2>Save Button:</h2>
            The save button is pressed to save the fitting method along with the peak pixel positions and their corresponding wavelength information as a CSV file.
